You can also accomplish the same using the below procedural approach even if your input contains alphabets with at least 3 numbers or more.

> If you will enter a string with less than 3 numbers also, function wil take care of it and return 0 for the corresponding variables. Examples are included at very bottom. Please have a look.

	import re

	def get_inputs(n=3):
		inp = input('Enter a sentence with at least 3 numbers included: ').strip()
		arr =  re.sub(r'[^0-9]+', ' ', inp).strip().split()

		if len(arr) < n:
			for i in range(n):
				try:
					arr[i]
				except IndexError as e:
					arr.append(0)

		n, a, k, *rest = list(map(int, arr))

		return (n, a, k, rest)

	# Start
	if __name__ == "__main__":
		# Get 3 numbers
		out1 = get_inputs() 
		n, a, k, rest = out1
		
		print('n =', n)
		print('a =', a)
		print('k =', k)
		print('rest = ', rest)
